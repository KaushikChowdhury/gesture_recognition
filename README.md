# gesture_recognition
Real-Time gesture recognition system

These scripts are modified from TwentyBN's GulpIO-benchmarks repository, written by Raghav Goyal and the TwentyBN team. These scripts serve as a starting point to create your own gesture recognition system using a 3D CNN.

The file video_to_frame.py has been attached to automate the process of extracting frames from videos.
